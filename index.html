                <p>i'm anthony maocheia-ricci, a student at the university of waterloo. i'm majoring in computer science with a specialization in human-computer interaction, a minor in psychology and other elective work in rhetoric.</p>
                <p>my interests are in fields such as user experience design, user interface development and interaction design. i'd like to learn more about user experience and human-computer interaction research and also have interest in digital media studies and findings.</p>
                <p>i'm currently interning at arctic wolf as a ux designer doing cool things with figma, and have previous experience working in development and instructional design at the university of waterloo's library.</p>

                <div class="accordbody" style="display: none;">
                    <p>throughout my work term at arctic wolf, i was tasked with a large UX research project regarding UI real estate and customization for an internal triaging tool. this project included preliminary research and designs, followed by semi-structured interviews and usability tests, and an iterative design process.</p>

                    </div-->
                    <h3>early designs</h3>
                    <p>to gain an understanding of the tool before entering the interview process with users, i had went through previous interviews and training recordings. from these, i made both low- and high-fidelity mockups on figma in order to gain a deeper understanding of what issues existed and where changes can be made — this lead to the discovery that different users would all have slightly different issues depending on monitor size, position at the company, or general workflow.</p>
                    <p>these designs were focused on three areas that were known to be pain points: layout organization options, filters, and the analyst notes pane.</p>
                    <div class="images3">

                    </div>
                    <h3>interviews</h3>
                    <p>through the interviewing process, i learned about many pain points that users had within the interface and was able to discover new issues to work into my general solutions. these mainly revolved around poor use of space for smaller fields, and a poor UX with scrollable elements throughout the interface. meeting these users proved to be extremely useful, as they were able to help through continued contact within the iterative design phase.</p>

                    <h3>experience vision</h3>
                    <p>in addition to the project, the company was also engaged in the UX strategy program offered by centre center. in discussion of UX outcomes after research had been underway, an experience vision was created for the general outcome of this project: <strong>if we do a great job with reorgnization options, we will improve the users' lives by tailoring the layout to their workflow so that they can triage more efficiently.</strong></p>
                    <div class="imagessolo"><img src="awpics/expvision.jpg" alt="The experience vision sketched and created"></div>
                    <h3>next steps</h3>
                    <p>after the main research and design iterations were completed, finalized designs were handed off to developers — but an additional part to the project was added. within interviews, issues were brought up about using this triaging interface for deeper investigations and the real estate issues were further stressed. along with findings from previous UXR projects, an ideation and early design phase was started for a new "investigations" interface, with low-fidelity sketches and high-fidelity wireframes created using miro and figma.</p>

            <h2>book list.</h2>
            <p>recently i've been reading books in a wide range of subjects, from ux design, to digital culture, to technology and how to (not) use it as much. my current read list is:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><em>Universal Methods of Design</em> by Bella Martin & Bruce Hannington</li>
                <li><em>The User Experience Team of One</em> by Leah Buley</li>
                <li><em>Interviewing Users</em> by Steve Portigal</li>
                <li><em>Digital Minimalism</em> by Cal Newport</li>
                <li><em>Memes in Digital Culture</em> by Limor Shifman</li>
                <li><em>Living in Data</em> by Jer Thorp</li>
                <li><em>The Design of Everyday Things</em> by Don Norman <strong>(IN PROGRESS)</strong></li>
            </ul>
            <p>as well, my backlog consists of:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><em>Because Internet</em> by Gretchen McChulloch</li>
                <li><em>Understanding Industrial Design</em> by Simon King & Kuen Chang</li>
            </ul>
            <p>i was (graciously) lended the first three books about ux design and research from my supervisor at my first co-op job with the university of waterloo's library after showing interest in ux work.</p>
            <h2>music.</h2>
            <p>i listen to a lot of music. as in over 80k minutes in 2021 on spotify. you can see my current obsessions below:</p>
            <iframe src="https://open.spotify.com/embed/playlist/37i9dQZF1EpwTC3Xr4fHXq?utm_source=generator&theme=0" width="100%" height="380" frameBorder="0" allowfullscreen="" allow="autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; fullscreen; picture-in-picture"></iframe>
            <h2>beliefs.</h2>
            <p>i have a strong personal belief that tech can be used as a tool for social good if those behind it care deeply enough about the users — and most importantly, remember that they are human. i recognize that i'm still super new to the field of ux, the tech world, and the studies of human interactions with computers and software and everything else that runs our digital worlds, but from what i've learned and personally experienced, we <strong>can</strong> use these devices to make positive change in the world; socially, environmentally, whatever.</p>
            <p>a scholar that keeps popping up in every elective i seem to take is marshall mcluhan (granted i've been mainly taking media, rhetoric and psychology electives) and one of his beliefs is that media and technology can be "extensions of man". everything we do for our user's digital experience, we do for the human behind the screen too.</p>
