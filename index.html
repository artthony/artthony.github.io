        <h3>about me.</h3>
        <p>my name is anthony maocheia-ricci, and i'm a grade 12 (senior) student in ontario! i've always had a love for computers, and have recently started to learn and explore various coding languages (and markup ones too!). i will be going to the university of waterloo for computer science (class of 2025), and i hope to work in the software industry in the future.
        <br/><br/>
        i have been using java in class for 3 years now (grades 10, 11 and 12), and have a fair knowledge on how to use it. i have also been self-teaching myself html and css concurrently.
        <br/><br/>
        i have worked at my karate dojo and have my black belt, teaching classes and greeting students at the front desk, along with being a summer camp leader (summer of 2018 & 2019) with my city's parks and recreation department, teaching science and reading-based camps to kids of all ages.
        <br/><br/>
