        <h3>about me.</h3>
        <p>
          my name is anthony maocheia-ricci, and i'm a 1B computer science student at the university of waterloo!
          i've always had a love for computers, and have recently started to learn and explore various coding languages
          (and markup ones too!). i hope to work in the software industry in the future.
          <br/><br/>
          i know how to code/script in java, html, css, javascript (including p5.js) and racket,
          and will be learning C in an upcoming course this winter.
          <br/><br/>
          i have worked at my karate dojo and have my black belt, teaching classes and greeting students at the front desk,
          along with being a summer camp leader (summer of 2018 & 2019) with my city's parks and recreation department,
          teaching science and reading-based camps to kids of all ages.
          <br/><br/>
