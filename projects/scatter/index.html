        <h2>personal project: scatternote</h2>
        <span class="accordinfo"><em><p>how might we organize our ideas to better solve problems?</p></em></span>
        <div class="accordbody">
            <p>scatternote is a proof of concept design for a notes app that helps organize your ideas automatically. this was done as a first attempt of a "case study" before my first experience in ux.</p>
            <h3>background</h3>
            <p>throughout university, i've found myself to be the type of person who loves to write my thoughts down when i feel i'm overwhelmed with life. even in discussion with friends, we all tend to write about our feelings in some sort of way; some friends prefer to use a physical journal, some have a never-ending notes file, some use specialized notes apps, and others use a private or <em>spam</em> social media account.</p>
            <p>in my personal experiences trying various options, i've made note of various pros and cons; from the full customization of a physical journal being inaccessible in the dark and requiring stationary to use, to a classic notes file having little customization options but easy accessibility, to the questionable privacy of a venting account.</p>
            <div class="imagessolo"><img src="../../scatterpics/schomeg.png" alt="The landing page for scatternote, with the heading text 'Welcome to Scatternote' and the text 'Scatternote is a different kind of notetaking app. Just type what you need to get done or get off of your mind and we'll do the organizing for you' below, followed by a get started button"></div>
            <h3>design process</h3>
            <p>from the discussions and my own personal experiece, i was able to group the main types of notes into the categories of needs, wants, or general thoughts. however - sometimes we don't know how to group our thoughts categorically (leading to the never-ending notes file). this lead to the idea that the software would categorize it automatically for you into those groupings, regardless of the style of input (a long-winded paragraph or short three-line memos).</p>

                <img src="../../scatterpics/scnoteg.png" alt="The note taking page in scatternotes, with the modal's title of 'new note' and default text prompting the user 'what's up'">
            </div>
            <h3>design concepts</h3>
            <p>this proof of concept was created with material you (material ui 3) guidelines in mind, inspired by the interface on my phone! this design language is a delight to use on a daily basis, where you'll notice various ways the colours change in applications based on your phone's theme, adding a touch of personality to your personal notes app.</p>
